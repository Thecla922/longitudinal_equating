# Methods for Longitudinal Equating

## Project Description

Understand if univariate equating solutions can recover a within-examinee growth curve. If not, propose a multivarite solution capable of recovering the within-examinee growth curve. 

## Research Design 

1. Gernerate item responses

2. Univariate equating
    1. Mean equating
    2. Linear equating
    3. Equipercentil equating 

3. Compare equated benchamrk scores to longitudinal anchor scores
    1. Univariate distributions
    2. Multivariate distributions (over time)

4. Multivariate equating

5. Compare multivariate equated score to longitidinal anchor score. 
    1. Univariate distributions
    2. Multivariate distributions (over time)
